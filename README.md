This is a small testing application just to have a glimpse of what Angular is. 
Since i love to travel, the idea of the application was due to that and I decided to make it a travel forum. I choose to build this project using Angular and TypeScript, as both of them are interly new  for me. I wanted to see if i can find concepts that are similar to React, but in my opinion they are very different frameworks. 
Have in mind as i`ve already said, the application may have bugs or things that are in development. Since it`s very hard for me to find information that is up-to-date with Angular`s updates, you are absolutely welcomed to contact me if u have worked with Angular or you may have an advice how to improve myself. 

Here are the functionalities that i have in mind to include in my project : 
- An user can register and have access to all the users` posts
- Each post can be liked or commented
- You can upload your personal posts, for example if you recently have been on a trip and you want to share with rest how was your experience there (Since i have a problem with using firebase`s Storage, the user has to upload any kind of photos using URL)
- You can also update your account information 
I  have many ideas, that i want to fullfill, but it is in process. 
I hope you enjoy my small project and of course, feel free to reachout to me for any improvements!
