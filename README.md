# 🌍 Travel-Forum

This is a small testing application developed to explore the basics of Angular. The idea of creating a travel forum stemmed from my love for travel. ✈️ I decided to build this project using Angular and TypeScript, both of which are new to me. Through this project, I aimed to identify similarities between Angular and React, but I found them to be very different frameworks.

Please note that this application is still in development and may contain bugs.🐞  You have may also noticed that almost everywehere the types for TS are written to 'any'. As i mentioned TS and Angular are unknown to me, my focus right now is on Angular`s basics and in the future i will correct the types when i have more solid understanding of how TS works.

Since it is challenging to find up-to-date information about Angular's updates, I welcome any advice or suggestions, especially from those with Angular experience. 📚

<h2> Functionalities 🛠️</h2>
Here are the functionalities I plan to include in this project:

<h4>User Registration: </h4> Users can register and access all posts. 📝 <br />
<h4>Post Interaction: </h4> Each post can be liked 👍 or commented 💬.   <br />
<h4>Personal Posts: </h4> Users can upload their own posts. For example, if you've recently been on a trip, you can share your experience with the rest of the community. (Due to issues with Firebase Storage, users must upload photos via URL.) 🖼️  <br />
<h4>Account Management: </h4> Users can update their account information. 🔄 <br />
