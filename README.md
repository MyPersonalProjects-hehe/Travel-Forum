# 🌍 Travel-Forum

<img src="https://github.com/MyPersonalProjects-hehe/Travel-Forum/blob/main/Untitled-2%20(2).png?raw=true" width="200" height="200">

This is a small testing application developed to explore the basics of Angular. The idea of creating a travel forum stemmed from my love for travel. ✈️ I decided to build this project using Angular and TypeScript, both of which are new to me. Through this project, I aimed to identify similarities between Angular and React, but I found them to be very different frameworks.

Please note that this application is still in development and may contain bugs. 🐞 Since it is challenging to find up-to-date information about Angular's updates, I welcome any advice or suggestions, especially from those with Angular experience. 📚

Functionalities 🛠️ <br />
Here are the functionalities I plan to include in this project:

User Registration: Users can register and access all posts. 📝
Post Interaction: Each post can be liked 👍 or commented 💬.
Personal Posts: Users can upload their own posts. For example, if you've recently been on a trip, you can share your experience with the rest of the community. (Due to issues with Firebase Storage, users must upload photos via URL.) 🖼️
Account Management: Users can update their account information. 🔄
I have many ideas that I want to fulfill, but they are still in progress. I hope you enjoy my small project, and of course, feel free to reach out to me with any improvements! 🌟
